                <h3>The Meaning of this Website.</h3> -->
                <p>
                    Have you ever had a project that was so dear to you, the one you worked so hard on and were incredibly proud of? This website is one of those projects for me. I wanted to design and build it from scratch,
                    I wanted to be able to change, add and remove what I felt needed to be edited. I wanted to be able to tailor the experience and the entire flow on here by what I believe is the best possible standard and outcome.
                    This website is a portal into my experiences, processes, and work ethic. It's a portal into my work and what I stand for.
                </p>

<!--                 
                <h3>Under Construction... For a while.</h3> -->
                <p>
                    This website will be updated every once in a while. I will always come back and edit it, optimize it and enrich the experience.
                    Every element in this website has been created by me: the icons, the mockups, the copywriting... Part of that is definitely because of inhert perfectionism, but it's mainly for me to develop as a creative. This website is where I can
                    delve, transform, and morph the concepts I have into components I can share with you all.  

                </p>
               
                <!-- <p>
                    Unfortunately, since this website is still under construction there will inevitably be incomplete pages and some inconsistencies. But I'm always checking and updating it and maximizing every 
                    detail so that there are as minimal irregularities as possible for the moment.
